first try the program heelo42.py by getting into this directory by typing

``` bash
cd \rocksetta-examples
```

remember to use the tab key as it auto-completes.

Then try the examples in this order

1. hello42
1.
1.
1.


The commands all work the same by running 

python filename.py

``` bash
python hello42.py
```
