# easy-tensorflow-on-cloud9
Hopefully the easiest way to get started with Google's TensorFlow Deep Learning Neural Network Python Library




install onto cloud9 http://c9.io as a custom workspace

Using the url for this repository 

https://github.com/hpssjellis/easy-tensorflow-on-cloud9.git


In the terminal type:
``` bash
bash setup.sh
```

OR JUST RIGHT CLICK AND SELECT RUN ON THE FILE setup.sh 

Note: Any of these examples can be run by just right clicking on the files and selecting run.

All files with the file name starting with rocksetta and ending with .sh should be able to be run this way.

Then hopefully try some examples in the rocksetta-example folder 

My TensorFlow API diagram is at http://rocksetta.com/tensorflow-teacher/tensorflow-svg.html which is a clickable version of

My Tensorflow-teacher site is at http://rocksetta.com/tensorflow-teacher/




Other peoples examples are in the other folders. 

A good starting point is the try-tf folder explained at this website

Side note:


using 

``` bash
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
```

sets up the environment

note just type 

``` bash
deactivate
```

to get your cursor back

I include this code in each of my .sh files but you could run the code in the command line and call the files normally.
